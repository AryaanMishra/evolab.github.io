# EvoLab Website

This is the official website for the EvoLab research group, built with Next.js, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the site.

### Build

Build for static export:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `out` directory.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the `main` or `master` branch.

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site.

3. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/ExpoReact-main` (or your custom domain)

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you want to deploy manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and deploy it to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package.

Note: You must have `gh-pages` installed (already in devDependencies) and your GitHub credentials configured.

### GitHub Pages Configuration

To enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Set the source to "GitHub Actions" (or "Deploy from a branch" if using manual deployment)
4. If deploying to a subdirectory, update the `basePath` in `next.config.mjs`
